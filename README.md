# Facebook Clone

1. Facebook as know as the most popular social media in  the world through more than 18 years since 2004.
2. Facebook was created the famous Front-end framework until now, which is React.JS.
3. We clone Facebook because we want to improve our skills when apply new knowledge to solve strange problems from existed production.


## INTRODUCTION
   1. Motivation:
        -   Facebook as known as the most popular social media in the world through more than 18 years since 2004.
        -   Facebook was created the famous Front-end framework until now, which is React.JS.
        -   We clone Facebook because we want to improve our skills when apply new knowledge to solve strange problems from existed production.
   2. Problem Statement:
        - 	We realized that the transferring among the social media have problem which have the limit.
        - 	Developing the connection, chatting feature through web.
        - 	Have the knowledge of pain point of Facebook when using RESTful API and improve to GraphQL.
   3. Scope:
        -   Propose to establish a social networking site for everyone connect to others. Work must be completed to finish the project of completing the website. As a             result, the scope of the project of building Facebook clone, coordination, and administration operations to guarantee the product scope is met. These                   efforts are included into the project management plan, which in turn is incorporated into the scope management plan. At the end of the project or phase,               the work accomplished is compared to the scope baseline in the project management plan to assess if the scope was effectively completed.
 ## LITERATURE REVIEW:
   1. Similar Application/System:
        -   Facebook is a social networking site that makes it easy for everyone to connect and share with family and friends online. It initially designed for college             students; Facebook was founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg while he was enrolled at Harvard University. By 2006, anyone who over the age of 13 with a valid             email address could join Facebook. Today, Facebook is the world's largest social network, with more than 1 billion users worldwide
   2.	Platform and Tools Reviews:
        - Platform: 
            Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface
        - Tools:
            IDE tool: VSCode ‚Äì The tool help developing more effectively with many use extension.

            API Testing: Postman ‚Äì The tool help checking the API during building a web app.

            DB management GUI: MongoDB Compass ‚Äì The tool help managing MongoDB database

            Cloudserver management: AWS Management Console ‚Äì The tool help managing the services of AWS such as AWS S3

            Proxy: nginx ‚Äì The open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, catching, load balancing.
            	
DNS management: Cloudflare ‚Äì help us manage DNS record
 ## SYSTEM DESIGN:
   1. System Requirement Specification:
        
        ‚Ä¢	Functional Requirements:
            
    o	React.JS: This is the free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.
            
    o	Axios: Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). On the server-side it uses the native node.js http module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.
            
    o	Redux: Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.
            
    o	MongoDB: is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s.
            
    o	Node.JS: Node.JS √≠ an open source server environment, it free, also runs on various platforms (Window, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, ‚Ä¶). Node.JS uses JavaScript on the server.
            
    o	Express.JS: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
            
    o	Socket.io: is an event-driven JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API.
        

‚Ä¢	Non-functional Requirements:
            
    o	AWS: Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms

    o	Cloudflare: Cloudflare, Inc. is an American content delivery network and DDoS mitigation company, founded in 2010. It primarily acts as a reverse proxy between a website's visitor and the Cloudflare customer's hosting provider. Its headquarters are in San Francisco, California.
            
    o	NGINX: An open-source web server that, since its initial success as a web server, is now also used as a reverse proxy, HTTP cache, and load balancer.
        
‚Ä¢	Requirements Analysis:

    o	Business requirements:
            1. These include high-level statements of goals, objectives, and needs. 
            2. Business requirements do not include any details or specific features. 
            3. They just state the problem and the business objective to be achieved such as:
                ‚Ä¢	Increased revenue/throughput/customer reach,
                ‚Ä¢	Reduced expenses/errors,
                ‚Ä¢	Improved customer service
    o	User requirements:
            1. The needs of discrete stakeholder groups (top-level managers, nonmanagement staff, customers, etc.) are specified to define what they expect from a particular solution. 
            2. This group serves as a bridge between the generalized business requirements and specific solution requirements. 
            3. They are outlined in a User Requirements Specification and can include, for example, ability to create various reports, view order history and status, manage customer databases, etc.

    o	Transition requirements:
            1. An additional group of requirements defines what is needed from an organization to successfully move from its current state to its desired state with the new product. 
            2. They are only necessary for the short period of time while the transition takes place. 
            3. Examples can be ‚Äúusers must be trained to operate the system‚Äù or ‚Äúprevious data must be migrated to the cloud storage.‚Äù
